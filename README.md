# Google Photos to iCloud Transfer Tool

## What's This?
This tool helps you move your photos from Google Photos to iCloud easily. It deals with the tricky parts, like putting all your files in one place and making sure that important details (like when and where your photos were taken) stay with your photos after they move.

## What Does It Do?
- **Pulling Files Together**: The `combine_files.py` script gathers all your photos and their details from different folders into one single spot.
- **Keeping Photo Details**: The `add_metadata.py` script makes sure that all the info about your photos (like when they were taken) sticks with them when they move to iCloud.
- **Doing It All in One Go**: The `main.py` script runs everything step by step without you having to worry about the nitty-gritty.

## Before You Start
You'll need:
- Python on your computer (version 3 or newer)
- Some extra libraries: `piexif`, `tqdm` 

## How to Use It
1. Get the script files git clone []
2. Open your favorite python IDE and run the main.py file, with the path to where your google photos currently are.
